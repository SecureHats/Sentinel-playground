# Sentinel Playground

The Sentinel playground is a project to deploy an initial Azure Sentinel environment pre-provisioned with sample data. 
This to speed up the deployment for Proof of Concept and demo scenarios.

#### Prerequisites

- Azure user account with enough permissions. See table below.

The following table summarizes permissions, licenses needed and cost to enable each Data Connector:

## ARM template instructions

The template performs the following tasks:

- Creates resource group (if given resource group doesn't exist yet)
- Creates Log Analytics workspace (if given workspace doesn't exist yet)
- Installs Azure Sentinel on top of the workspace (if not installed yet)
- Creates a temporary Azure Container Registry
- Creates a used assigned identity for executing the deployment scripts
- Creates a Deployment script (if given deployment script doesn't exist yet)

In order to execute the deployment scripts, the deployment template uses an [ARM deployment script](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deployment-script-template) which requires a [user assigned identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). You will see this resource in your resource group when the deployment finishes. You can remove after depployment if desired.

It takes around **10 minutes** to before that sample data is visible.

## Supported Providers
- Aruba 
- Cisco
- Symantec

## ToDo
- Add more data providers
- Add more parsers
- Clean-up Deployment Scripts
- Enables analytics rules for selected Microsoft 1st party products 
- Enables Fusion rule and ML Behavior Analytics rules for RDP or SSH (if Security Events or Syslog data sources are selected)
- Enables Scheduled analytics rules that apply to all the enabled connectors
